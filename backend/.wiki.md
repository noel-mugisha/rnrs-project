# Project Summary
The Job Portal Backend API is designed to facilitate job searching and recruitment processes. This comprehensive backend system allows job seekers to manage their profiles, apply for jobs, and track their applications, while job providers can post job openings, manage applications, and communicate with candidates. Built using Express.js, TypeScript, and Prisma with PostgreSQL, this API integrates essential features such as user authentication, resume management, and notifications, creating a seamless experience for both job seekers and employers.

# Project Module Description
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Handles user registration, login, and email verification with JWT and OTP.
- **User Management**: Manages user profiles, including job seekers and employers.
- **Job Management**: Allows job providers to create, manage, and publish job listings.
- **Application Management**: Enables job seekers to apply for jobs and track their application status.
- **Resume Management**: Facilitates uploading and managing resumes using Cloudinary.
- **Notification System**: Sends notifications to users regarding application statuses and other updates.
